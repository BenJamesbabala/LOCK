# Introduction
Robotics is a multi-disciplinary field with its heart dependent on the bleeding edge algorithms of AI, Control Optimization etc. There lies its inherent potential of delivering theory intensive courses like control theory, artificial intelligence and computer vision in an intuitive and informal manner.

Through a series of three tutorials you will ready to set up your own differential steering robot capable of navigating to given any co-ordinate while avoiding obstacles with only a static camera mounted on the ceiling as shown below. By following and implementing the code examples on LOCK, you will be ready to build more interesting and complex systems. Now lets crack on.
